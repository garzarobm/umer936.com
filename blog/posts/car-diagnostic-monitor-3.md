Project 3: Car Diagnostics Monitor and Logger
Type: Personal, Role: Independent Creator Description:
A bit of an older project, but useful. I wanted to learn about and be able to see my car’s usage. I had an unused RaspberryPi computer, so I ordered a Bluetooth OBD-II (On-board diagnostics) device. From there, I started reading into CAN bus and engine codes accessible through OBD-II. I then found a Python script to connect the OBD-II and the RPi, which I then adapted to log the info every 1/4 sec. When I arrive home, the RPi connects to WiFi and pushes the data to my GitHub and I can graph out data, such as RPM, intake temperature, tire pressures, and engine codes. Through this, I learned about the computer systems in cars and wiring to a car fuse box. Also, it is a plug-and-play car diagnostics checker for under $50. Pictured here [4] is the RPi seated in my glove compartment and a printout of dataset from revving the throttle.
This project was done by me prior to the tools that now exist on the market for doing something similar. Additionally, the high-tech cars of today have all this information available through the manufacturer’s tools, but this still allows for a more privacy-oriented method of data collection.
