Project 4: Intelligent Quads
Type:
Professional/Personal
Description:
Two of my co-founders and myself spun off Intelligent Quads (IQ) from our student organization Texas Aerial Robotics (TAR) in order to create a modular, customizable drone platform to allow companies and researchers to develop their own drone applications.
By being in the aerospace labs, we found that the researchers did not have the tools they needed to do what they wanted. If a graduate student was working in the lab, they may have the best computer vision (CV) algorithm, but their drone didn’t fly straight because there is no good way to build out and test their CV without building the drone. Taking the Raspberry Pi model of an extensible base, we found a gap where no other companies service. DJI is the closest manufacturer; however, due to US industry and government restrictions on Chinese products and software, it does not fill the gap. DJI also focuses on photography and hobbyist usecases. Then the other end is the big military drones from Lockheed Martin or Boeing, who are not interested in such a market.
Thus we developed a small drone [5], called the 200 IQ.
 This was a small drone with: • 12x12 in form factor
• 2 stereo cameras
• 1 main camera
• 300 gram payload
• Nvidia Jetson for GPU/Computer Vision/AI capabilities • Some GPS denied capabilities

Due to timings, we tabled the startup attempt and transformed it into an educational platform on YouTube where we are the best channel showcasing how to create autonomous aerial vehicles in simulation and real life.
